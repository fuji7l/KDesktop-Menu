here for backup or archival purposes.  If you want to get it to work on
KDE 3.5 though, feel free and I'll gladly merge it

I may get back into doing this for Plasma

__( KDesktop Menu About )______________________________________________________

  KDesktop Menu is a replacement menu for use with kicker (KDE).  It was
  inspired from the Gnome menu applet.... heavily.

  You will find the configuration dialog has many tool tips and "What's This?"
  items so if you're ever curious about a setting, the information is there
  somewhat.

  If you find any bugs, please report it to rfujimoto@imap.cc

__( KDesktop Menu Requirements )_______________________________________________

  For the life of me, I can't figure out this auto-stuff so I couldn't hard
  code this information.

    - kdelibs 3.5 ( This applet uses kio_media and data set from the component
                    chooser. To be safe, 3.4 is required.  It may work with 3.3
                    though )
    - kdebase 3.5 (kicker, libkonq, and probably more).
    - >=qt 3.3
