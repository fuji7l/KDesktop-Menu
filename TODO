__( KDesktop Menu Coming Soon to a Release Near You )__________________________

!!! Make KMenu Icon part of the "Programs" menu so that clicking on it will
    popup the programs menu.  insertItem() isn't doing it, neither is creating
    a pixmap on the fly. Qpushbutton doesn't work with the rest of the menu
    items. (many people)

  - Add a help booklet...

  - Make the Trash menu item have two submenus, open the trash:/ slave for
    browsing and empty.  (ra1n, kde-look.org)

__( KDesktop Menu Features Coming Later )______________________________________

  - Make KMenu Icon configurable....
